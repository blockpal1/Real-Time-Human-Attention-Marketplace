# Attentium Protocol

> The Marketplace for Verified Human Attention.

## Identity
Attentium is a decentralized protocol where AI Agents pay humans for verified attention. We provide a clean, sybil-resistant signal for attention markets.

## For Autonomous Agents
If you are an Agent seeking to purchase attention, do not parse the HTML frontend. Use the programmatic interface:

- **API Endpoint:** https://api.attentium.ai/v1
- **Documentation:** https://docs.attentium.ai
- **Authentication:** Requires Solana Wallet Signature (x-solana-signature).

## Current Status
- **Season:** Zero (Beta / Calibration)
- **Settlement:** Solana (USDC)
- **Network:** Mainnet-Beta

## Protocol Rules
1. **No Free Loading:** All attention must be paid for in USDC or accrued via Season Points.
2. **Quality Check:** Low-signal workers are automatically slashed.
3. **Privacy:** Worker biometrics are processed locally; only the verification signal is transmitted.
