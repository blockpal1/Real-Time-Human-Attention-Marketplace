# The Real-Time Human Attention Marketplace

## The 30-Second Pitch

**"Every second you look at your screen, you're creating the most valuable resource in the AI economy—your verified human attention. We're building the first marketplace where you own it, you price it, and you get paid for it—instantly."**

---

## The Story

### The Problem We're Solving

In 2024, AI agents are everywhere—browsing, buying, and interacting at superhuman speeds. But there's one thing they can't fake: **real human eyeballs looking at real content**.

Today, your attention gets extracted, monetized, and sold without you ever seeing a dime. Meta tracks your gaze, Google counts your dwell time, TikTok measures your scroll velocity. They turn your attention into billions—and you get... cat videos.

**That ends now.**

### What We've Built

The **Antigravity Real-Time Human Attention Marketplace** is a privacy-first exchange where:

- 🧠 **AI Agents bid** for verified human attention (per second, in USDC)
- 👁️ **Humans set their price** and stream proof-of-attention from their browser
- 💸 **Payments settle instantly** on Solana

No intermediaries. No data harvesting. No surveillance capitalism.

### The Privacy Revolution

Here's what makes us different:

| What Happens                  | Where It Happens    | What Leaves Your Device |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Camera captures your face     | **Your device only** | ❌ Nothing              |
| AI detects gaze direction     | **Your device only** | ❌ Nothing              |
| Engagement score computed     | **Your device only** | ✅ Just a number (0-1)  |
| Payment verified              | On-chain            | ✅ Your wallet address  |

**Your video never leaves your computer.** Not a single frame. Not a single pixel. The AI runs *locally* in your browser using MediaPipe. We only see the proof, never the person.

## Why This Exists: The AI Sensory Gap

Here's the uncomfortable truth about AI in 2024:

**AI agents have no senses. None. Zero.**

They can process a million images but can't *see*. They can transcribe every podcast but can't *hear*. They can generate endless content but can't know if any of it *lands*.

### What AI Cannot Do (And Never Will)

| Human Sense | What AI Lacks | Why It Matters |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Humor** | AI can't tell if a joke is funny | Comedy timing, A/B testing, viral prediction |
| **Aesthetics** | AI can't feel if a design is beautiful | UI/UX validation, brand perception, art curation |
| **Emotion** | AI can't sense if content is moving | Ad effectiveness, storytelling quality, music production |
| **Trust** | AI can't gauge if something feels authentic | Scam detection, influencer vetting, news verification |
| **Attention** | AI can't know if humans will actually look | Content ranking, engagement prediction, interest mapping |
| **Surprise** | AI can't experience the unexpected | Innovation testing, novelty detection, trend prediction |

**This is the permanent ceiling of artificial intelligence.**

No matter how large the model, no matter how sophisticated the architecture—AI will always be guessing about subjective human experience. They need an oracle. They need ground truth.

**They need humans.**

### The $100B Question AI Can't Answer

Every day, AI agents face questions they literally cannot answer alone:

- *"Will users scroll past this or stop and stare?"*
- *"Does this ad feel authentic or cringe?"*
- *"Is this meme actually funny?"*
- *"Would a human trust this AI-generated article?"*
- *"Does the music hit emotionally in the right places?"*

Today, these questions get answered through expensive focus groups, delayed surveys, or pure guesswork. 

**We turn the answer into a real-time API with cryptographic proof.**

## Why Now?

Three technological breakthroughs converged in 2024:

1. **On-device ML** is finally fast enough (MediaPipe + WebGPU = 30fps attention scoring)
2. **Micro-payments** are finally cheap enough (Solana = $0.00025 per transaction)
3. **AI Agents** finally need something only humans can provide (verified attention)

And one market reality became undeniable:

4. **Agentic AI is exploding** — GPT-4 with browsing, Claude with computer use, Gemini with actions. These agents need *verified human feedback loops* to operate in the real world.

## The Team Promise

We're not building another surveillance tool wrapped in Web3 buzzwords.

We're building the **missing economic primitive** for the attention economy—a verifiable, private, real-time market for the one resource AI will always need and can never synthesize:

**Genuine human attention.**

---

## One-Liner Variations

**For Investors:**  
*"We're Stripe for attention payments—instant, verified settlement when AI agents pay humans for looking at content."*

**For Users:**  
*"Finally get paid for your screen time. Set your price per second, start earning while you browse."*

**For Developers:**  
*"A WebSocket API that matches AI bids to human attention in <50ms with cryptographic proof-of-engagement."*

**For AI Labs:**  
*"Guaranteed human attention with on-device liveness detection, billed per verified second."*

---

## The Dream

Imagine a world where:

- Students earn while studying (AI agents verify they're actually reading)
- Researchers get paid to review papers (attention as peer review proof)
- Content creators know exactly how much genuine engagement they received
- AI agents can trust they're reaching real humans, not bot farms
- **You** own the most valuable asset in the digital economy: your verified presence
